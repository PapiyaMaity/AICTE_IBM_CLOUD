Project Name: Fitness Buddy – Your AI-Powered Virtual Health Coach
🔍 Objective:
To develop a conversational AI-based virtual fitness assistant that helps users maintain a healthy lifestyle by offering personalized fitness routines, motivational support, and nutritional advice—accessible anytime, anywhere.

🎯 Features
⦁	Conversational AI—Friendly chat-based Q&A for fitness, meals, and motivation.
⦁	Built on Free Tier—No paid IBM Cloud resources required.
⦁	Prompt-engineered—Uses effective system prompts for high-quality, relevant responses.
⦁	Live Web or API Use—Deployable as a webchat widget, API endpoint, or directly via IBM Prompt Lab.

Usage:

⦁	You can interact with Fitness Buddy via:
⦁	IBM watsonx.ai Prompt Lab (test prompts directly)
⦁	Deployed Web Chat Widget (if integrated)
⦁	REST Endpoint (send requests via curl/Postman/custom app)
⦁	Prompt Lab Testing Open your Fitness Buddy asset in IBM watsonx.ai Prompt Lab.
⦁	Type a question in the “Test” or “Preview” section.
